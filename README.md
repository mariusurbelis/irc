### An assignment for Networks and Data Communications module (AC31008)
A server and a bot. The server allows users to connect and chat in channels which the users themselves are able to create. The bot, on the other hand, connects to the server and is able to respond to commands like !time !day. Also, whenever pinged with a private message the bot responds with a random Trump tweet.
